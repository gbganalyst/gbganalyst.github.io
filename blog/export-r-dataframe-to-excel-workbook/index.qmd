# Introduction

The `openxlsx2` package provides an efficient way to export multiple data frames from R into an Excel workbook, where each worksheet in the workbook corresponds to a specific data frame in R.

# Prerequisites

This tutorial begins by ensuring that the necessary packages are installed and loaded.
If they are not already present in your R environment, the following code will download and install them.
Note that an internet connection is required for this step.

```{r}
#| label: Install-Package 
#| 
if (!require(install.load)) {
  install.packages("install.load")
}

install.load::install_load(c("openxlsx2", "readxl", "purrr"))

```

# Preparing the Data

In this example, we will export four commonly used datasets: `airquality`, `mtcars`, `iris`, and `diamonds`, each to a different worksheet within the same Excel workbook.

```{r}
#| label: data-preparation
#| 
dataframe1 <- datasets::airquality
dataframe1 |> head()

dataframe2 <- datasets::mtcars
dataframe2 |> head()


dataframe3 <- datasets::iris
dataframe3 |> head()

dataframe4 <- ggplot2::diamonds
dataframe4 |> head()
```

# Exporting Data Frames to Excel

Now that we have our data frames prepared, we will assign them to individual worksheets in an Excel workbook.
The worksheet names will correspond to the names of the data frames in R.
For example:

-   sheet1- airquality
-   sheet2- mtcars
-   sheet3- iris
-   sheet4- diamonds

```{r}
#| label: export-to-excel
#| 
list_of_datasets <- list("airquality" = dataframe1, 
                         "mtcars" = dataframe2, 
                         "iris" = dataframe3, 
                         "diamonds" = dataframe4)

write_xlsx(list_of_datasets, "Excel_workbook.xlsx")
```

After running the code, you will find the Excel_workbook.xlsx file in your working directory.

# Verifying the Export

You can verify the content of the Excel workbook either by opening it in `Excel` or by using `R`.
Below, we'll check the worksheet names and inspect the contents of each worksheet using the `readxl` and `purrr` packages.

```{r}
#| label: verify-worksheets
excel_sheets("Excel_workbook.xlsx")
```

To explore the content of each worksheet:

```{r}
#| label: inspect-worksheets
path <- "Excel_workbook.xlsx"

path |>
  excel_sheets() |>
  set_names() |>
  map(read_excel, path = path)
```

# Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrated how to efficiently export multiple data frames to separate worksheets in an Excel workbook using R.
The approach is highly customizable, allowing for easy integration into your data analysis workflow.
