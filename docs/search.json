    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nIn today’s fast-paced academic landscape, establishing a strong online presence is crucial for scientists to showcase their research, connect with peers, and build their professional brand. Don’t get me wrong, a digital publication list is nice and cool; but having a personal website means much more than a mere collection of papers. It is a great tool to highlight our achievements, foster collaborations, and inspire others on a global scale. Let’s take a look at five compelling reasons why you should consider creating your own website as well.\n\n\nReason 1: Showcase Your Work\nImagine having a central hub where you can effectively present your research achievements, publications, and expertise to the scientific community and beyond. A personal website provides precisely that. By curating your work in one place, you can stand out in the competitive scientific landscape and make it easier for others to discover and appreciate your valuable contributions. This platform offers a great view of your research journey.\n\n\nReason 2: Expand Your Network\nCollaboration is key to scientific progress. Your personal website acts as a gateway, connecting you with fellow scientists, potential collaborators, and industry professionals. It opens doors to new opportunities and facilitates the expansion of your professional network. By providing contact information and writing about your research interests, you can attract like-minded individuals who share your passion and expertise. Through your website, you can foster collaborations, exchange ideas, and forge valuable connections.\n\n\nReason 3: Have Control Over Your Content\nIn today’s digital age, maintaining control over your online presence is essential. While social media platforms and other online channels offer great reach, they often come with limitations and constraints. A personal website grants you the freedom to share your research findings, insights, and perspectives on your own terms. You are not bound by character counts or algorithmic filters. This level of control allows you to maintain a professional online persona while freely expressing your thoughts and ideas.\n\n\nReason 4: Reach an Audience\nWhile traditional scientific publications are the currency of academia, their reach can be limited. A personal website breaks down these barriers and makes you reach a global audience. By sharing your research with the world, you can engage with science enthusiasts, inspire others, and make a lasting impact beyond academic papers. Whether your goal is to communicate complex scientific concepts to a broader audience or connect with fellow researchers on a global scale, a personal website will bring you one step closer to your goal.\n\n\nReason 5: Enhance Opportunities\nA personal website is a way for potential employers and academic institutions to find out about your work, achievements, and contributions. It offers them a comprehensive understanding of your expertise, research interests, and the impact of your work. By showcasing your accomplishments and highlighting your unique perspectives, you can enhance your chances of exciting career opportunities.\n\n\nHow to Start Today\nSo why wait? Take the leap and create your personal website today! To assist you, I have prepared a free tutorial and template to get you started on the right foot:\n\n\n\nConclusion\nHaving a personal website empowers you to showcase your work, expand your professional network, maintain control over your content, reach a global audience, and enhance your career opportunities. Remember: Your research is valuable, and you can create a personal website to put yourself out there and share your knowledge with others in no time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nThe openxlsx2 package provides an efficient way to export multiple data frames from R into an Excel workbook, where each worksheet in the workbook corresponds to a specific data frame in R.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nThis tutorial begins by ensuring that the necessary packages are installed and loaded. If they are not already present in your R environment, the following code will download and install them. Note that an internet connection is required for this step.\n\nif (!require(install.load)) {\n  install.packages(\"install.load\")\n}\n\ninstall.load::install_load(c(\"openxlsx2\", \"readxl\", \"purrr\"))\n\n\n\nPreparing the Data\nIn this example, we will export four commonly used datasets: airquality, mtcars, iris, and diamonds, each to a different worksheet within the same Excel workbook.\n\ndataframe1 &lt;- datasets::airquality\ndataframe1 |&gt; head()\n\n\n  \n\n\ndataframe2 &lt;- datasets::mtcars\ndataframe2 |&gt; head()\n\n\n  \n\n\ndataframe3 &lt;- datasets::iris\ndataframe3 |&gt; head()\n\n\n  \n\n\ndataframe4 &lt;- ggplot2::diamonds\ndataframe4 |&gt; head()\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nExporting Data Frames to Excel\nNow that we have our data frames prepared, we will assign them to individual worksheets in an Excel workbook. The worksheet names will correspond to the names of the data frames in R. For example:\n\nsheet1- airquality\nsheet2- mtcars\nsheet3- iris\nsheet4- diamonds\n\n\nlist_of_datasets &lt;- list(\n  \"airquality\" = dataframe1,\n  \"mtcars\" = dataframe2,\n  \"iris\" = dataframe3,\n  \"diamonds\" = dataframe4\n)\n\nwrite_xlsx(list_of_datasets, \"Excel_workbook.xlsx\")\n\nAfter running the code, you will find the Excel_workbook.xlsx file in your working directory.\n\n\nVerifying the Export\nYou can verify the content of the Excel workbook either by opening it in Excel or by using R. Below, we’ll check the worksheet names and inspect the contents of each worksheet using the readxl and purrr packages.\n\nexcel_sheets(\"Excel_workbook.xlsx\")\n\n#&gt; [1] \"airquality\" \"mtcars\"     \"iris\"       \"diamonds\"\n\n\nTo explore the content of each worksheet:\n\npath &lt;- \"Excel_workbook.xlsx\"\n\npath |&gt;\n  excel_sheets() |&gt;\n  set_names() |&gt;\n  map(read_excel, path = path)\n\n#&gt; $airquality\n#&gt; # A tibble: 153 × 6\n#&gt;    Ozone Solar.R  Wind  Temp Month   Day\n#&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt;  1    41     190   7.4    67     5     1\n#&gt;  2    36     118   8      72     5     2\n#&gt;  3    12     149  12.6    74     5     3\n#&gt;  4    18     313  11.5    62     5     4\n#&gt;  5    NA      NA  14.3    56     5     5\n#&gt;  6    28      NA  14.9    66     5     6\n#&gt;  7    23     299   8.6    65     5     7\n#&gt;  8    19      99  13.8    59     5     8\n#&gt;  9     8      19  20.1    61     5     9\n#&gt; 10    NA     194   8.6    69     5    10\n#&gt; # ℹ 143 more rows\n#&gt; \n#&gt; $mtcars\n#&gt; # A tibble: 32 × 11\n#&gt;      mpg   cyl  disp    hp  drat    wt  qsec    vs    am  gear  carb\n#&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt;  1  21       6  160    110  3.9   2.62  16.5     0     1     4     4\n#&gt;  2  21       6  160    110  3.9   2.88  17.0     0     1     4     4\n#&gt;  3  22.8     4  108     93  3.85  2.32  18.6     1     1     4     1\n#&gt;  4  21.4     6  258    110  3.08  3.22  19.4     1     0     3     1\n#&gt;  5  18.7     8  360    175  3.15  3.44  17.0     0     0     3     2\n#&gt;  6  18.1     6  225    105  2.76  3.46  20.2     1     0     3     1\n#&gt;  7  14.3     8  360    245  3.21  3.57  15.8     0     0     3     4\n#&gt;  8  24.4     4  147.    62  3.69  3.19  20       1     0     4     2\n#&gt;  9  22.8     4  141.    95  3.92  3.15  22.9     1     0     4     2\n#&gt; 10  19.2     6  168.   123  3.92  3.44  18.3     1     0     4     4\n#&gt; # ℹ 22 more rows\n#&gt; \n#&gt; $iris\n#&gt; # A tibble: 150 × 5\n#&gt;    Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species\n#&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;  \n#&gt;  1          5.1         3.5          1.4         0.2 setosa \n#&gt;  2          4.9         3            1.4         0.2 setosa \n#&gt;  3          4.7         3.2          1.3         0.2 setosa \n#&gt;  4          4.6         3.1          1.5         0.2 setosa \n#&gt;  5          5           3.6          1.4         0.2 setosa \n#&gt;  6          5.4         3.9          1.7         0.4 setosa \n#&gt;  7          4.6         3.4          1.4         0.3 setosa \n#&gt;  8          5           3.4          1.5         0.2 setosa \n#&gt;  9          4.4         2.9          1.4         0.2 setosa \n#&gt; 10          4.9         3.1          1.5         0.1 setosa \n#&gt; # ℹ 140 more rows\n#&gt; \n#&gt; $diamonds\n#&gt; # A tibble: 53,940 × 10\n#&gt;    carat cut       color clarity depth table price     x     y     z\n#&gt;    &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt; &lt;chr&gt;   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n#&gt;  1  0.23 Ideal     E     SI2      61.5    55   326  3.95  3.98  2.43\n#&gt;  2  0.21 Premium   E     SI1      59.8    61   326  3.89  3.84  2.31\n#&gt;  3  0.23 Good      E     VS1      56.9    65   327  4.05  4.07  2.31\n#&gt;  4  0.29 Premium   I     VS2      62.4    58   334  4.2   4.23  2.63\n#&gt;  5  0.31 Good      J     SI2      63.3    58   335  4.34  4.35  2.75\n#&gt;  6  0.24 Very Good J     VVS2     62.8    57   336  3.94  3.96  2.48\n#&gt;  7  0.24 Very Good I     VVS1     62.3    57   336  3.95  3.98  2.47\n#&gt;  8  0.26 Very Good H     SI1      61.9    55   337  4.07  4.11  2.53\n#&gt;  9  0.22 Fair      E     VS2      65.1    61   337  3.87  3.78  2.49\n#&gt; 10  0.23 Very Good H     VS1      59.4    61   338  4     4.05  2.39\n#&gt; # ℹ 53,930 more rows\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThis tutorial demonstrated how to efficiently export multiple data frames to separate worksheets in an Excel workbook using R.

    "text": "What is an API?\n\n\n\nImage source: Unsplash\n\n\nAn API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of protocols, routines, and tools used for building software applications. It is essentially a set of rules and methods that data analyst or software developers can use to interact with and access the services and features provided by another application, service or platform.\nIn simpler terms, an API allows different software applications to communicate with each other and share data in a standardized way. With APIs, developers or analysts can get data without needing to scrape the website, manually download it, or directly go to the company from which they need it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: How API work\n\n\n\nFor example, if you want to integrate a weather forecast feature into your app, you can use a weather API that provides the necessary data, rather than building the entire feature from scratch. This allows you to focus on the unique aspects of your app, without worrying about the underlying functionality."

    "text": "How to fetch API data using a programming language\n\nwith R\nThere are several packages available in R for consuming APIs. Some of the most commonly used packages are:\n\nhttr: This package provides convenient functions for making HTTP requests and processing the responses.\njsonlite: This package is used for parsing JSON data, which is a common format for API responses.\nRCurl: This package is a wrapper around the libcurl library, which is a powerful and versatile HTTP client library.\n\nTo get data from an API in R, you need to follow these steps:\n\nInstall the required packages by running the following command in the R console:\n\n\ninstall.packages(c(\"httr\", \"jsonlite\", \"RCurl\"))\n\n\nLoad the packages by running the following command:\n\n\nlibrary(httr)\n\nlibrary(jsonlite)\n\nlibrary(RCurl)\n\n\nMake an API request by using the GET function from the httr package. The API endpoint should be passed as an argument to this function.\n\n\nresponse &lt;- GET(\"https://api.example.com/endpoint\")\n\n\nCheck the status code of the response to see if the request was successful. A status code of 200 indicates a successful request.\n\n\nstatus_code &lt;- status_code(response)\n\n\nExtract the data from the response. If the API returns data in JSON format, you can use the fromJSON function from the jsonlite package to parse the data. Store the data in a variable for later use.\n\n\napi_data &lt;- fromJSON(content(response, as = \"text\"))\n\nThese are the basic steps to get data from an API in R. Depending on the API, you may need to pass additional parameters or authentication information in your request. For example,\n\nresponse &lt;- GET(\n  \"https://api.example.com/endpoint\",\n  authenticate(\n    user = \"API_KEY_HERE\",\n    password = \"API_PASSWORD_HERE\",\n    type = \"basic\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\nwith Python\nTo use an API in Python, you can use a library such as requests or urllib to send HTTP requests to the API and receive responses. Here’s an example of how to use an API in Python using the requests library:\n\nimport requests\n\n# Define the API endpoint URL and parameters\nendpoint = 'https://api.example.com/data'\n\nparams = {'param1': 'value1', 'param2': 'value2'}\n\n# Send a GET request to the API endpoint\nresponse = requests.get(endpoint, params = params)\n\n# Check if the request was successful\nif response.status_code == 200:\n    # Parse the response JSON data\n    data = response.json()\n\n    # Process the data, for example by printing it to the console\n    print(data)\nelse:\n    print(f'Error: {response.status_code}')\n\nIn this example, we’re using the requests library to send a GET request to an API endpoint at https://api.example.com/data, passing two parameters (param1 and param2) in the request. The requests.get() method returns a Response object, which we can use to check the response status code and parse the response data.\nIf the status code is 200, we can assume the request was successful, and we can parse the response data using the response.json() method, which converts the JSON-formatted response to a Python object. We can then process the data as needed, for example by printing it to the console.\nOf course, the exact API endpoint and parameters will depend on the specific API that you are using, and you’ll need to consult the API documentation to learn how to construct your request correctly. But this example should give you a sense of the general process involved in using an API in Python."

The good news is: You don’t have to write new YAML blocks; you just have to enter some info in the appropriate places. Let’s go through the _quarto.yml file step by step.\n\n2.3.1 Author info\nIt’s time to tell the readers about yourself. Fill in your details, such as your name (title field), a brief description, and a global image of yourself.\n\n\n2.3.2 Navigation\nThe navigation in the template is split in two parts. The left side contains icons for your social links, such as Twitter, GitHub, or email.\nThe right side links to other pages of your website. Each navigation entry consists of a title (text), followed by a link (href). Take a look at the example entries and continue the pattern as you see fit.\n\n\n2.3.3 Advanced settings\nThe rest of the _quarto.yml file just controls that we will indeed create a website, our preview tab doesn’t change all the time, and we can publish our website without complications. Don’t mess with this part unless you know what you are doing. If you do know what you are doing: Move fast and break things 😉\n\n\n2.3.4 More config tweaks\nThis blog post covers the fundamentals to set you up with a working website. Are you hungry for more and want to pull an all-nighter because creating a website can be super addictive? The official Quarto Documentation contains a bunch of other settings you can tweak via the _quarto.yml configuration.

It is a great opportunity to tell them a bit about yourself and spark their interest.\nIn this template, we are not designing a full landing page from scratch. Instead, we use one of the great template designs that are shipped with Quarto. Template inception. We will basically feed Quarto the info to create a pretty “About” section, where users see your image, some social links, and a brief description.\nOpen the /index.qmd file and inspect the header, that is, the part at the top of the source code which is enclosed in --- delimiters:\n\n\n/index.qmd\n\n---\nabout:\n  template: jolla\n  id: about-block\n  image: img/my_image.png\n  links:\n    - icon: twitter\n      text: Twitter\n      href: https://twitter.com/MarvinSchmittML\n    - icon: github\n      text: Github\n      href: https://github.com/marvinschmitt\n    - icon: linkedin\n      text: LinkedIn\n      href: https://www.linkedin.com/in/marvin-schmitt-a85b321a2/\n    - icon: envelope\n      text: Email\n      href: \"mailto:mail.marvinschmitt@gmail.com\"  \n---\n\nAll following fields are nested in the about field, which is our way of telling Quarto that all the subsequent information should be associated with our “About” section. The template is called jolla, and you can find other options here. The id field assigns a name to the “About” section such that you can insert it anywhere in your page. As the name might suggest, the image field contains the path of an image to display on your landing page. Finally, the links field contains a bunch of social links. Each social entry consists of three fields:\n\nicon: identifier of an icon, such as twitter or envelope. You can take a look at the Standard Bootstrap5 Icons for more icon names.\ntext: description of the entry, usually for accessibility\nhref: link, make sure to add mailto: before an email address\n\nAs you can see in the /index.qmd file, the “About” block is inserted in the actual document via\n\n\n/index.qmd\n\n::: {#about-block}\n:::\n\nand you can add a nice introduction about yourself below the block."

    "text": "3.2 Preparing your website for GitHub pages\nThe template already contains all necessary settings for GitHub pages, so you don’t have to do anything in this section. However, it’s always good to have a superficial understanding of how things work, and it’s fairly staightforward in this case. We use the simplest form of GitHub pages: We build the entire website locally (i.e., in RStudio) and output the built page into the docs/ folder. This is configured in the output-dir field of the almighty _quarto.yml:\n\n\n_quarto.yml\n\nproject:\n  type: website\n  output-dir: docs\n\nWe commit this docs/ folder to GitHub, and GitHub pages simply uses that folder to serve our website. This has one important consequence: If we make any change to our website, we have to Render the website again in RStudio. That’s how the updates make it to the docs/ folder! Only changing the .qmd file is not enough because GitHub does not render our site directly from the .qmd source.\nIf you are not familiar with programming at all, just imagine it like this: You are a real estate agent with a downtown office. You have your current listings in your street-facing window. You always write your listings in Microsoft Word, and those documents are of course saved as .docx files on your computer. However, those documents somehow have to get from your computer to the window display.\nThat’s the job of your friendly assistant Paige. You and Paige have agreed on the following workflow. You have a folder docs/ where you save all current listings as PDF files. Paige will monitor this docs/ folder, and whenever there is a change, Paige will print the PDF and replace the listing in the window display. Sounds like a straightforward process, right? That’s pretty much what we are doing in our deployment pipeline as well:\n\n\n\n\nReal Estate Agent\nYou\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment\nMicrosoft Word\nRStudio\n\n\nSource files\n.docx\n.qmd\n\n\nOutput folder\ndocs/\ndocs/\n\n\nDeployment\nAssistant (Paige)\nGitHub Pages\n\n\nOutput format\n.pdf\n.html\n\n\nServing platform\nWindow display\n&lt;domain&gt;.github.io\n\n\n\nNote to advanced readers: You can set up a GitHub action to let GitHub build the website directly from the source files. But that deserves its own tutorial since some bugs persist which make things awkward (as of February 2023). If you would like to see automatic deployment covered in a future blog post, please let me know!\nThe second change to our website files is to include an empty file with the name .nojekyll (already included in the template). Usually, GitHub pages does some post-processing on your website files with Jekyll. Since Quarto handles all the processing we need, we want to deactivate Jekyll’s post-processing. Adding a .nojekyll file to your website root directory does exactly that: It bypasses post-processing via Jekyll."

    "text": "5.1 General web development tips\nHere are some general web development tips, ranging from file management and DNS over to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.\n\n5.1.1 Relative links\n\nThanks to Paul Buerkner for requesting this\n\nSuppose you are editing the file projects/index.qmd and want to add a link to the page &lt;name&gt;.github.io/photography. You can of course link to the full URL &lt;name&gt;.github.io/photography, but that link will break if you change your domain name to www.&lt;name&gt;.com. Instead, you can use relative links. You only need to know that ../ takes you one layer back on the folder tree.\nExample: Starting from projects/index.qmd, you can use ../photography/index.qmd to walk back one layer into the root folder of your website, and then move into the folder photography/, where index.qmd of photography lives. This relative path is valid no matter what domain you use. It only breaks if you decide to remodel the entire structure of your website. But in this case, I assume you know what you are doing and you’re well off on your own 😉\n\n\n5.1.2 CSS flavors\n\nThanks to Andrew Heiss for making me aware of SCSS from studying the source code of his website\n\nQuarto supports some cool CSS variants, such as SCSS. In SCSS, you can add variables such as $orange to define your favorite color once and use it in many different places. This deserves a separate blog post, though.\n\n\n5.1.3 Include Order\nIf you mix HTML with CSS and JavaScript, make sure to include the files in the correct order. If your JavaScript manipulates existing HTML objects through the DOM, make sure to include the JavaScript file after the HTML body. If you include the JavaScript before the HTML body, JavaScript will not know that the HTML objects exist, and you will have a bad time. Been there, spent well over 2 hours debugging. 0/10, cannot recommend."

    "text": "5.2 Quarto specific tips\nHere are some tips that are specific to Quarto, Markdown, or RMarkdown.\n\n5.2.1 Adding a table of contents\n\nThanks to Paul Buerkner for requesting this\n\nThanks to Quarto, it’s super easy to add a table of contents. Just add the following lines to the header of your .qmd file, without any indentation:\n\n\nindex.qmd\n\ntoc: true\ntoc-title: Contents\ntoc-location: left\n\n\n\n5.2.2 Labels and references\nIf you are familiar with \\(\\LaTeX\\), you might appreciate proper references with \\label{sec:introduction} and \\autoref{sec:introduction}. The Quarto equivalent is {#sec-introduction} for the label and @sec-introduction for the reference."
